# Good ReadMe Generator

## Description

Developers would like to save time when generating ReadMe's for their projects, and this application generates a sufficient ReadMe by prompting the user to enter content from the command line.

This application features a use of npm packages which, after prompting the user to enter pertinent ReadMe information, generates a ReadMe file based on this content. The 'inquirer' package allows for user answers to questions on the command line to be stored for use in the ReadMe generation. The 'axios' npm package is used to make calls to the Github API to include developer-specific Github information on the ReadMe.
